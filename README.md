# Project
My project work

This is a github page with my final year project in. The project is to create a neural network capable of predicting and validating nuclear
data. The end goal is to provide a proof-of-concept AI that can, for a limited number of situations, emulate the quality of the work produced by
TALYS but in a much shorter timeframe.
